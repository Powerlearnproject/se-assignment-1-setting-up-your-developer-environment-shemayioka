# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.







1. Document Detailing the Setup Process
This document outlines the steps to set up a developer environment for Python development using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Git version control, and a MySQL database (optional).
1.1 Install Text Editor/IDE
•	Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
1.2 Set Up Version Control System
•	Create a GitHub Account: Sign up for a free GitHub account at https://github.com.
•	Install Git: Download and install Git for your operating system following the instructions on the official Git website: https://www.git-scm.com/downloads.
•	Configure Git: Open a terminal window and run the following commands to configure Git with your name and email address (replace <your_name> and <your_email> with your details):
Bash
git config --global user.name "<your_name>"
git config --global user.email "<your_email>"
•	Initialize a Git Repository: 
1.	Open a terminal window and navigate to your project directory.
2.	Run the following command to initialize a Git repository:
Bash
git init
•	Make a Commit: 
1.	Stage the files you want to include in your first commit using the git add command. For example, to add all files in the current directory:
Bash
git add .
2. Type a descriptive commit message and run the `git commit` command to create a commit:
Bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
1.3 Install Programming Languages and Runtimes
•	Install Python: Download and install the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Make sure to add Python to your system path during installation.
1.4 Install Package Managers (Optional)
•	Install pip (Python Package Manager): Python comes with pip pre-installed by default. You can verify its installation by running pip --version in your terminal.
1.5 Configure a Database (MySQL) (Optional)
•	Download and install the MySQL Community Server from the official website: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html (instructions for other platforms are available on the website).
•	Follow the installation instructions for your operating system. This will typically involve setting up a password for the root user.
1.6 Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional)
•	Consider using tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and configurations. This can be helpful for managing complex projects and ensuring consistent environments across different machines. Tutorials and documentation for these tools can be found online.
1.7 Explore Extensions and Plugins
Open VS Code and go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+).
•	Search for extensions that can enhance your development experience. Some recommended extensions for Python include: 
o	Python (official extension)
o	Pylint (linter for Python code)
o	Jedi (advanced autocompletion for Python)
•	Install the extensions.
